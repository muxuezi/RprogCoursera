I just wanted to briefly describe how to
install R for a Windows machine.
So the first thing you need to do is
load, launch your web browser, so I'll do
that here.
I'm using Chrome, but it doesn't really
matter.
And you need to go to the Comprehensive R
Archive Network or CRAN.
So I'll just type that in here.
And you'll see that there's a, at the top,
there's three options.
There's Linux, Mac and Windows, so you can
go to the Mac version here.
And you want to go, click on the base link
here.
[COUGH] And at the very top, you'll see
download
R 3.0.3 for Windows, and that's exactly
what you want.
So you can just click on this link, and
the download will start.
And so, depending on how fast your
internet
connection is, this might take a few
minutes.
Okay, so the download's finished.
I'm going to click on this.
And you'll probably have to click on Yes
for this.
And so, you can choose your language here,
there are a number
of choices in terms of the translations
that you can choose from.
So I'm going to choose English because
that's my
language, then you can just click through
the installer.
It will kind of walk you through the
various steps and so
we'll do that right now, just see what the
options are.
So you click on Next, you have to agree to
the license, which is the gen, GNU General
Public License, so.
Feel free to read it and then click on
Next.
The use of the default installation
directory
is fine so I'm going to go through this.
The use, the default user installation is
fine.
There are other kind of installation
setups that you can choose from.
If you know you only, you have a 32 bit
machine maybe an older machine but you
could click on that.
By default it will install both versions,
so
you don't really need to worry about that.
So just click through Next on this one.
And you can choose to kind of take all the
defaults, or you can try to customize your
startup.
I'm going to customize the startup just so
you
can see kind of what the options are here.
So this option here shows you whether,
asks
you whether you want an MDI or SDI
interface.
So what that means is basically, do you
want R to kind of run in one big window.
With kind of different sub-windows with,
inside of a big window or
do you want it to run in kind of like
separate windows?
I prefer to use the SDI mode where the, so
the console will
be in one window and the kind of graphics
window will be a separate window.
I just kind of, I feel like it, I like
that a little better.
It's easier to work with so I'm going to
click on the SDI option.
And then you can choose how you want to
look at your help files.
So the HTML help is a little bit nicer,
it's prettier to
read and the plain text help is well, it's
just plain text.
So maybe I'll just click on plain text
just to be different.
And then you can choose whether want
Standard or Internet2 internet access.
This, generally speaking, you should not
mess with, so you just click on Next.
You can create a shortcut in the Startup
me, Start menu, so that's usually a good
idea.
And you can usually click choose the
defaults here in terms of creating a
desktop icon unless your desktop is very
cluttered and you want to you know, avoid
that.
So these are, these defaults are fine, so
I'll click on
Next, and then it will start installing
the files on your computer.
So now it's done and we can just click on
Finish here and, and you've now installed
R on your computer.
And so I'll just close this browser here
and I see you've got, I got a
desktop icon here, so I'll just double
click
on that and there we are, we're running R.
