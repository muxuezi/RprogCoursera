Hi everyone, thanks again for joining our
programming.
I just want to make one quick note about
the
version of R that you'll be using in this
class.
You might notice from some of the videos
that the videos are made using R version
3.0.3, which was the most current version
at the time when the video was made.
However as of now, the most current
version of R is 3.1.1.
And so I encourage you to install that
version of R.
Which should be the default version that
you find when you go to the R website.
So don't try digging around for older
versions of R you won't need them.
So I, in general I always encourage people
to
use the latest version of software because
those will
have the latest features and they will
have hopefully
fixed bugs that may have been present in
earlier versions.
So, for this version of the course for use
for R version 3.1.1.
Thanks a lot.
