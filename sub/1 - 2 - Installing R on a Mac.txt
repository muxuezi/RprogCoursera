In this video I'm going to briefly show
how you can install R on the Mac.
It's a very simple process.
You just have to, it only takes a few
steps.
So the first thing you need to do is open
your web browser.
And
go to CRAN, so that's the Comprehensive R
Archive
Network, so I can just type in CRAN here.
And you'll see that [COUGH] there are a
number
of options for you to download here for
different platforms.
And so we're going to download the Mac
platform here.
So we can go to Download R for the Mac,
and you see that the latest version here
is version 3.0.3.
And you want to download this package file
here, so just
click on this, and you'll see that the
download meter will
start going And it might take a few
minutes depending
on the speed of your internet connection,
so just be patient.

Okay, so it's finished downloading.
So I'm just going to open up here.
The package I can see that it'll start the
installer.
And I'll guide you through all the steps
you need to install R 3.0.3.
So I'll click Continue here and this is
just the description of what's going to
get installed.
Hit Continue.
The Software License Agreement is the GNU
General Public License, version 2.
So you should agree the license after
having read it, of course.
And then you can just click Install here.
And you might have to type in your
administrative password.
So just go ahead and do that.
And it'll start installing the files on
your computer.

Now that's finished I can hit Close and
then it'll be in my Applications folder.
So I can just go to my Applications folder
which is right here.
And they're in alphabetical order so lets
scroll down to R and there it is.
And there you have it, you have installed
R on your computer.
And now you can go ahead you can just use
it directly or if
you want to you can install an interface
like R Studio if you like.
